# Intelligent Face Recognition Attendance System For UPES Students

Attendance is an important part of daily classroom evaluation. At the beginning and ending of class, it is usually checked by the teacher which is tedious and time-consuming, but it may appear that a teacher may miss someone or  some students answer multiple times. Face recognition-based attendance system is a problem of recognizing face for taking attendance by using face recognition technology based on high-definition monitor video and other information technology.

## Methodology

A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a student face from a digital image frame against a database of faces.  OpenCV and face_recognition library in python. Face_recognition library uses on dlib in the backend.

#### **What is OpenCV?**
OpenCV is a real-time Computer Vision framework. It is used in many image processing and computer vision tasks. OpenCV is written in C/C++, but we can use it in python also using OpenCV-python.

#### **What is dlib?**
Dlib is a Open Source C++ toolkit. It contains various machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software.
